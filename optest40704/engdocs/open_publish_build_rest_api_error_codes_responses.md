# Open Publishing Build Rest API Error Codes and Responses

The Open Publishing Build Rest API attempts to return appropriate [HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) for every request.

**HTTP Status Code**|**Text**|**Description**  
---------|---------|---------|----------

302 | Redirect | OAuth login callback for Vso/GitHub
400 | BadRequest | Required field(s) or parameter(s) has not been provded, the value supplied is invalid, or the combination of provided fields is invalid
401 | Unauthorized | Authentication credential was missing, expired or incorrect
403 | Forbidden | Request doesn't have sufficient permission for accessing specified resource
404 | NotFound | Resource was not found which is specified in request
409 | Conflict | Create a resource which conflicts with an already existing one
422 | UnprocessableEntity | Failed to create a build from filtered branch, normally occurs for Vso/GitHub notification
500 | InternalServerError | A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered, e.g, insert/update Azure table failed
501 | NotImplemented | API has not implemented

## Structured Errors
When the Open Publishing Build Rest API returns error response, the body includes a machine-readable `error`, a human-readable `message` and a `documentation_url` pointing the client to further information about the error and how to resolve, e.g.,

```json
{
  "error": "UnsupportedProjectGetOperation",
  "message": "Only Vso supports get projects operation",
  "documentation_url": "https://ppe.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/openpublishing/docs/open_publish_build_rest_api_error_codes_responses",
  "recommended_action": "Make sure you are login with Vso, for GitHub we don't support this API",
  "component": "Open Publishing Build Rest Api Service"
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The error codes will stay the same, while the text for an error message may change.
