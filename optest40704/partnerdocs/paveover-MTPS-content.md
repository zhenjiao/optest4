# Retiring your MTPS content (migration from MTPS to Open Publishing)

If you are migrating your content from MTPS (published with PWS or the Build Sytem) to Open Publishing, we recommend you that you retire the MTPS content so it does not appear in the search engines, and redirect it to the OP content. 

Steps:
1. Publish your OP content.
2. Apply 301 redirection from your MTPS content to the OP content. You can do that via CAPS or have our team do it for you. If choose the latter, please fill out a request via the [MSDNHelp portal](http://msdnhelp/).  
3. Select the tile labelled **Library Support Request (formerly MSDNHelp@)**.  
4. Under **Request type**, please select "Pave over/redirect obsolete topics". **Please make sure you fill out the template included at the top of the form and include it in your request.**
 
> [!NOTE] 
> You do no longer need to republish your content. We will set the content as NoIndex/NoFollow and remove it from search engines for you as part of the redirection.
