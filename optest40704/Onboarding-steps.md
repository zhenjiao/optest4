# Onboarding to Open Publishing

We can have several cases of onboarding into Open Publishing, depending if a team creates content for the first time or it already exists. Thus, not all the steps might be applicable to your team. No worries, we will work with you on a more detailed schedule with all the steps needed for your project. 

The following is a list of tasks both content owners and VSC need to do for onboarding:


**Task**|**Owner**|**Estimated duration**
