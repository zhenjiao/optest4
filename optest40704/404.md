# Customized 404 Page

In case your customer enters a URL which is in the scope of your domain base path, but not referenced by any content you published, they would be redirected to a 404 page. 

In most cases, site would provide a default 404 page. If you'd like to provide your user a better experience, you can create a file 404.md in the root folder of your docset, then ops will bring user to the 404 page you specified. 

You can show your user to [Introduction](index.md) page to find what they need using your customized 404 page.
